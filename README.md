# elevator_rs

Clone and then run `cargo +nightly run` or `cargo +nightly run --release`

Use arrow keys, space bar shoots gun and Z jumps.

A couple notes:
- You might need amethyst nightly build (and rust nightly)
- The elevator itself is still pretty buggy
- The escalators still don't work
- look at todo.md for a "complete" list of issues
- release build uses a lot less CPU and has higher frame rate
