# Things that need to happen

## High priority
- [x] fix collision with elevator to make it not wonky when jumping - not a great solution
- [x] hop when approaching an elevator
- [x] change the elevators to know which floor number they are on (ie. use a start number/offset)
- [ ] door logic
- [ ] create a system for knowing when the player is near an elevator (or on an elevator)
- [ ] draw elevators in proper places based on tiles
- [ ] don't move elevators unless user is inside (ie. can't control from the top)
- [ ] parallax
- [ ] add bad guys and AI

## Medium priority
- [x] fix gun transformations so that it looks correct
- [x] fix elevator so that it waits 

## Low priority
- [ ] increase user velocity when riding up elevator so jump is additional
- [ ] Ducking when on top of elevator
