# Things that need to happen

## High priority
- [x] fix collision with elevator to make it not wonky when jumping - not a great solution
- [x] hop when approaching an elevator
- [x] change the elevators to know which floor number they are on (ie. use a start number/offset)
- [x] door logic for drawing doors in correct places
- [x] open doors when user is nearby and facing and they have documents
- [ ] draw the empty room behind it
- [ ] animate the user going into the room and coming out
- [ ] mark room as used when user comes out
- [ ] animate user when he enters a door
- [ ] create a system for knowing when the player is near an elevator (or on an elevator)
- [ ] draw elevators in proper places based on tiles
- [ ] don't move elevators unless user is inside (ie. can't control from the top)
- [ ] parallax
- [ ] add bad guys and AI

## Medium priority
- [x] fix gun transformations so that it looks correct
- [x] fix elevator so that it waits 
- [ ] player falls off the elevator when going up from bottom floor
- [ ] lamps falling and lights out

## Low priority
